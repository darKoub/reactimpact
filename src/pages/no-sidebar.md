  #### Entire Project on a CDN


  Because Jamstack projects don’t rely on server-side code, they can be
  distributed instead of living on a single server. Serving directly from a CDN
  unlocks speeds and performance that can’t be beat. The more of your app you
  can push to the edge, the better the user experience.


  #### Everything Lives in Git


  With a Jamstack project, anyone should be able to do a`git clone`, install any
  needed dependencies with a standard procedure (like`npm install`), and be
  ready to run the full project locally. No databases to clone, no complex
  installs. This reduces contributor friction, and also simplifies staging and
  testing workflows.


  #### Modern Build Tools


  Take advantage of the world of modern build tools. It can be a jungle to get
  oriented in and it’s a fast moving space, but you’ll want to be able to use
  tomorrow’s web standards today without waiting for tomorrow’s browsers. And
  that currently means Babel, PostCSS, Webpack, and friends.


  #### Automated Builds


  Because Jamstack markup is prebuilt, content changes won’t go live until you
  run another build. Automating this process will save you lots of frustration.
  You can do this yourself with webhooks, or use a publishing platform that
  includes the service automatically.


  #### Atomic Deploys


  As Jamstack projects grow really large, new changes might require re-deploying
  hundreds of files. Uploading these one at a time can cause inconsistent state
  while the process completes. You can avoid this with a system that lets you do
  “atomic deploys,” where no changes go live until all changed files have been
  uploaded.


  #### Instant Cache Invalidation


  When the build-to-deploy cycle becomes a regular occurrence, you need to know
  that when a deploy goes live, it really goes live. Eliminate any doubt by
  making sure your CDN can handle instant cache purges.
